# ICS2210 Course Project 2024

This project was created for the ICS2210: Data Structures and Algorithms 2 course assesment. It implements and collects statistics for various data structures including AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees, and Skip Lists. In addition to this, the Knuth Shuffle algorithm is also implemented.

## Folder Structure

#### Data_Structures: this folder contains the code implementation. 
It has the following files:
- [`avl_tree.py`](Data_Structures/avl_tree.py): Contains the implementation of the AVL Tree data structure.
- [`red_black_tree.py`](Data_Structures/red_black_tree.py): Contains the implementation of the Red-Black Tree data structure.
- [`skip_list.py`](Data_Structures/skip_list.py): Contains the implementation of the Skip List data structure.
- [`knuth_shuffle.py`](Data_Structures/knuth_shuffle.py): Contains the implementation of the Knuth Shuffle algorithm.
- [`ds_statistics.py`](Data_Structures/ds_statistics.py): Contains the implementation of the statistics collection for the data structures.
- [`main.py`](Data_Structures/main.py): The main file that uses the data structures and collects the statistics.

#### Documentation.pdf: This file contains the documentation for the assignment. 
The plagiarism form and statement of completion are included as part of the pdf file.
